# 04_Web-AI-ML

A hands-on repository exploring the intersection of web technologies and machine learning using Python. Core topics include logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and dataset-driven model development. Projects demonstrate data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and integration into web-based workflows. Postman is used occasionally for API testing and interaction. This repo is ideal for learners and developers aiming to build intelligent systems with practical ML foundations.
